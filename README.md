# Fligh Footprint Tracker

## This site is dedicated to calculating the ecological footprint of airline flights.

By ecological footprint we mean the environmental impact that our actions or simply our habits can have. In the context of air travel our aim is to calculate the environmental impact due to carbon dioxide emissions.

## Why it is important?

We live in an era where air travel is very easy and cheap.
This leads more people to use this type of transport.
However, at the same time, we have a climate crisis to face.
Through “Flight Footprint Tracker” it is possible to calculate in a simple and intuitive way the amount of CO₂ that is emitted into the atmosphere for each person present in the flight.

## How it works?

On the home page of the site there is a small presentation and a form to fill out.
There are three fields to fill in: the city of departure, the city of arrival and the number of passengers on the flight. When I search for the city using the "Cerca" button, a small menu will appear where I can choose the airport.

Once all three fields are filled in (if the one relating to passengers is not filled in, only one passenger is taken into consideration), a screen will appear with various results:

- CO₂ emissions from a single passenger.
- CO₂ emissions of the entire flight, including all passengers.
- The possibility of donating a to offset the environmental impact of our flight.

## Conclusions

The goal of all this is to raise awareness of a topic that is too often overlooked. We don't have to give up travelling, but we can do it in a more conscious way, making more sustainable decisions and, if we have the possibility, donating small sums for activities and projects aimed at building a better future.
